B)
empty = Number of empty slots in the buffer (used by the producer).
full = Number of filled slots in the buffer (used by the consumer).
Workflow:
Producer Waits on empty (to make sure there's space).
Produces an item.
Posts (increments) full.

Consumer Waits on full (to make sure there’s something to consume).
Consumes an item.
Posts (increments) empty.

Main Idea:
These semaphores coordinate access so the buffer doesn’t overflow (producer adds too much) or underflow (consumer takes when nothing is there).

C) 
Role of sleep() in Producer & Consumer
sleep(rand() % 3) adds a random delay (0 to 2 seconds).
Simulates real-world timing where production/consumption doesn’t happen instantly.
Prevents the output from flying by too fast.
Helps visualize step-by-step execution and synchronization.
